      <h2>What are your delivery options and how much is shipping?</h2>
      <p>
        Currently we are only offering service for picking up from store due to
        the nature and freshness of our product, which means there is no
        additional cost for shipping.

      <h2>What happens if I can&apos;t pick up my order?</h2>
      <p>
        All orders need to be picked up on the requested date to ensure
        freshness and quality of your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have paid for the item, we will hold it for an additional 24
        hours after the requested pick-up time. After 24 hours it will be sold
        and no refunds or replacements possible.

        be sold the following day with no replacements.
